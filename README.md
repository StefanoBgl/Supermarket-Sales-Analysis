This project analyzes a supermarket sales dataset to uncover **customer behavior patterns**, **product performance**, and **strategic business insights**. The goal is to explore how customers interact with the store, what drives sales, and how customer profiles differ based on time, location, and purchasing habits.

The notebook combines **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** with **clustering techniques** to segment customers and guide data-driven decisions.
